# ParallelPy

ParallelPy is a tool for running Tyro from a GitHub repository. Tyro is a first step in converting Python programs to PySpark programs.

## Getting Started

Before you can run Tyro, you'll need to make sure you have **Git** installed on your computer. If not, you can download it from the official website.

Once Git is installed, open a **terminal** or **command prompt** and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Use the command `git clone https://github.com/sanjelarun/ParallelPy.git` to **clone** the repository to your local machine.

After cloning the repository, navigate into it using `cd ParallelPy/parallelpy`.

## Directory Structure

The ParallelPy project contains several directories:

- `data`: This directory contains data files used by Tyro.
- `examples`: This directory contains example files that can be used as input for Tyro.
- `output`: This directory  contains output files generated by Tyro.
- `parallelpy`: This directory contains the main source code for Tyro.
- `result`: This directory contains result files generated by Tyro.
- `templates`: This directory contains template files used by Tyro.

## File Structure

The `parallelpy` directory contains several files:

- `__init__.py`: This is an empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.
- `analysis.py`: This file  contains code for analyzing data or results.
- `ast_test.py`: This file contains code for testing abstract syntax trees (ASTs).
- `main.py`: This is the main entry point for the program. Running this file will likely execute the main functionality of the ParallelPy tool.

## Running Tyro

To run Tyro, use the command `python main.py` from within the `ParallelPy/parallelpy` directory.

If you want to change the input file used by Tyro, you can do so by editing the value of the `filepath` variable in `main.py`. There are a few example files available in the `/examples` folder that you can use.

### Please note
Before running Tyro, please be aware of these important points:
1. The verifier module may not work in this version; however, it might give you a rough idea about how the project runs.
2. The project may not be complete and polished so you might encounter numerous errors.

Before running Tyro, make sure to install all dependencies mentioned in `requirements.txt`.
